# Graph mining for the detection of overcrowding and waste of resources in public transport

The imbalance between the quantity of supply and demand in public transport systems causes a series of disruptions in large metropolises. While extremely crowded vehicles are uncomfortable for passengers, virtually empty vehicles generate economic losses for system managers, and this usually comes back to passengers in the form of fare increases. Here a new methodology will be presented for the evaluation of collective transportation systems. It proposes the construction and mining of graphs that represent complex networks of supply and demand of the system to find such global imbalances.
